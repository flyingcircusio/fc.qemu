fc.qemu development
===================

We assume that you have a local checkout on your machine for editing
and that you synchronize that code (e.g. with rsync when saving) to
a remote machine, typically our hydra server. To run the tests of your development version, you need a (current or "suitable") checkout of
the platform code as well:

    local$ ssh hydra01.fcio.net
    hydra01 ~ $ cd fc-nixos

    hydra01 ~/fc-nixos $ nix-shell
    hydra01 ~/fc-nixos $ nix-build --arg useCheckout true tests/kvm_host_ceph-luminous.nix

To run only some tests you can pass arguments to pytest:

    hydra01 ~/fc-nixos $ nix-build --arg useCheckout true --argstr testOpts "-k test_agent_check"  tests/kvm_host_ceph-luminous.nix

Real-world testing on FCIO DEV network
--------------------------------------

* create branch on fc-nixos
* commit your fc.qemu changes
* update the qemu package reference to your commit
* use fc-nixos dev-checkout on the host(s) you want to test
