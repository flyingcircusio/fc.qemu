Release notes
=============


0.8.9 (2017-04-07)
------------------

- Improve guest agent communication. The guest agent may be in an
  inconsistent state that causes it to hang. We've seen this happening
  where we froze machines and then have the agent be inconsistent.

  This now properly resets the agent connection upon a sync by sending
  the recommend "wrong" UTF-8 byte that guarantees to interrupt the
  guest agent's JSON parser.

- Improve logging output when destroying a VM because of an inconsistent
  state. (#25158)


0.8.8 (2016-11-18)
------------------

- Bugfix: migrations that ran into a timeout because the remote side
  did not respond accidentally unlocked and cleaned up without shutting
  the VM down properly. This resulted in multiple instances of a single VM.

0.8.7 (2016-11-11)
------------------

- Don't change anything if a VM is marked online but no KVM host is assigned
  (#23965).
- Refactor Agent.ensure() for improved reliability and readability.
- Decline to create a consistent snapshot if a VM is offline.
- Speed up tests a bit.
- Don't spawn unqualified partprobe invocations in parallel.
- Make debug level logging a bit less verbose.


0.8.6 (2016-11-04)
------------------

- Break inconsistent Ceph locks if the host holding an old lock is sure that a
  VM is not running anymore (#23695).
- Migration compatibility between Qemu 2.5 and 2.7 (#23695).
- Always clean up unused resources like Consul service registrations and run
  files.
- Improve error reporting and logging.


0.8.5 (2016-10-31)
------------------

- Fixed a major bug with event processing: the consul event processor was
  using the multiprocessing.pool API incorrectly. This wasn't caught by the
  tests and resulted in silent "no ops" of all event processing mechanisms.


0.8.4 (2016-10-31)
------------------

- Waiting for Qemu to shutdown gracefully was not expecting a socket error,
  which caused restarts to fail (cleanly). #24434

- Limit the number of parallel processed consul events to avoid
  overloading the host. Can be configured in the fc-qemu config file through::

    [consul]
    event-threads = <INT>

  The default is 10 threads.

- Lower the overhead of processing a consul config change event: do not
  activate Ceph and Qemu connections and do not perform scrubbing (ensure)
  when the config hasn't changed. Ceph and Qemu connections aren't needed in
  that case and scrubbing is expected to be performed in a separate task from
  a scheduler, not from an event handler that is supposed to only respond to
  changes.

- Provide a default for the binary-generation counter to allow smooth
  upgrades from previous versions.


0.8.3 (2016-10-23)
------------------

- Lower the guest agent timeout to help the tests complete faster and also
  stay responsive if the guest shouldn't have an agent available either
  yet, or currently, or generally.

- Provide a Qemu config template variable that will determine the most current
  Qemu machine type, given a prefix to filter for.

- Provide a "binary generation counter" that is a) injected a boot
  (to /tmp/fc-data/qemu-binary-generation-booted) and b) updated during every
  "ensure" command (to /run/qemu-binary-generation-current). The guest should
  use a difference between those files to schedule a cold reboot (i.e. a
  shutdown) to restart with a fresh Qemu binary.


0.8.2 (2016-09-20)
------------------

- Switch from using multiprocessing to threaded management of multiple consul
  VM event handlers to reduce Python startup overhead when processing many VMs
  in a single location. Also remove the sleep time.

- Fix log error in consul snapshot event handling. Improve the test coverage
  for consul event handling.

- Remove superfluous VM name handling where a VM config file could be
  specified instead of a VM name. This was causing obfuscation in the code
  and was barely used anyway.

- Allow using the telnet command even when fc.qemu _thinks_ that the VM
  is not running. This command is helpful for debugging and blocking it
  is a useless seatbelt.

- Do not log QMP connection errors as the are extremely common and expected.


0.8.1 (2016-09-11)
------------------

- Explicitly add logging to /var/log/fc-qemu.log. Do not filter
  log output there: we always want all the information we can get.

0.8 (2016-09-08)
----------------

- Introduce `fc-qemu telnet` command: a shortcut to connect to the human
  monitor port without having to look up the port from a config manually.

- Switch the monitor automation from using the telnet port to using the QMP
  socket. This should be a _lot_ more reliable. This also fixes a previous
  race condition where a migration status check may intermittently fail and
  then break a migration unnecessarily.

- Update vagrant environment to check against Qemu 2.6.

- Revamp output formatting to use Hynek's great structlog library.

- Limit a few more commands to specific VM states: stop only when running.

- Implement IOPS limiting either based on VM-specific ENC data,
  a Ceph pool default, or a global default. This limits IOPS for all disks
  (individually, no groups, yet) in a VM and maintains this over time.

- Rework Ceph volume unlocking: if a client owns a lock then breaking it
  will cause an immediate disconnect of the rbd/rados connection to avoid
  it sending further data updates. This can happen to us if we're setting
  up the locks on an inmigration and then have to give them up again if the
  migration fails.

0.7.22 (2016-07-21)
-------------------

- Fix bug in `fc-qemu restart` which causes mkfs.xfs for tmp to fail.


0.7.21 (2016-06-20)
-------------------

- Moderate swap and tmp volume sizes so that they do not scale linearly for very
  large VMs. #21961


0.7.20 (2016-05-03)
-------------------

- More logging output to help diagnosing a rare lock recovery failure
  (#21345).
- Remove shrink-vm. R.I.P. (#14222).


0.7.19 (2016-04-08)
-------------------

- Fix a race condition: when continuously polling monitor status to determine
  whether a VM is running, also consider the option that the VM was about
  to shutdown and the monitor has gone away.


0.7.18 (2016-04-04)
-------------------

- Another brownbag release: the snapshot refactoring wasn't tested properly
  if snapshots actually existed.


0.7.17 (2016-04-04)
-------------------

- Fix unicode/str issue: consul json decoded into unicode but librbd requires
  a plain string.

0.7.16 (2016-03-31)
-------------------

- Fix regression in snapshot taking.


0.7.15 (2016-03-20)
-------------------

- Account for different mkfs options for XFS and mkfs.ext4 (#19079).
- Improved Vagrant VM bootstrapping.
- Refactor classes in hazmat/{ceph.py,volume.py} (#19079).
- Use the "rbd_pool" ENC option to allow VM-specific selection of the RBD pool
  instead of deriving it from the resource group name.
- Improve success rate of recovering from failed migrations properly: certain
  conditions would result in only partially released locks from the target
  leading to inconsistent states.

0.7.14 (2016-01-21)
-------------------

- Use XFS for tmp partitions (#17873).
- Drop super-floppy setup von vdc and use a proper partition table instead
  (#17873).
- Fix file permissions for ENC seed JSON file.


0.7.13 (2015-12-10)
-------------------

- Ignore consul requests for VMs with missing configuration (#18841).
- Speed up initial NTP sync in Vagrant to avoid failing Ceph tests due to
  unsynced MONs.
- Refine Ceph.unlock() to remove own locks in a best-effort manner. This is
  needed to recover from incomplete migrations (#18771).
- Improve error handling with failed monitor connections.


0.7.12 (2015-11-11)
-------------------

- Improve error handling during migration.
- Fix timeout during fsfreeze that leads to locked up VMs (#18917).


0.7.11 (2015-11-04)
-------------------

- Switch `aio` setting in default qemu.vm.cfg to "threads". This will keep
  fc-qemu compatible with future Qemu versions (#18743).
- Improve logging.
- Place initial copy of ENC data in `/tmp/fc-data/enc.json`.


0.7.10 (2015-08-12)

- Spawn individual VM actions usings multiprocessing. Wait until all migrations
  are done (#14920).
- Increase allowed migration downtime to keep migration time for busy VMs in
  bounds (#14920).
- Fix exception handling errors during Consul event processing (#14920).
- Give udev mapping a bit to settle.

0.7.3 (2015-06-02)
------------------

- Make event processing from consul fork for each VM and return the
  master process early to avoid blocking the consul agent.

- More logging related to migrations.


0.7.2 (2015-05-26)
------------------

  wild.


0.6.3 (2015-02-19)
------------------

- Improve pid file parser to deal correctly with trailing lines and empty pid
  files.
