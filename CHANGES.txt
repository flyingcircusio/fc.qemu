------------------

- Improve logging and error messages (#13867).
- Fix unwanted behaviour during error conditions (#13867).


0.6 (2015-01-15)
----------------

- Implement live migration. Use "inmigrate" and "outmigrate" commands
  to coordinate the process (#13229).
- Note that the qemu.cfg.in template has changed!
- Improve test coverage.


0.5.1 (2014-11-22)
------------------

- Bugfix: remove Ceph discard call since it seems to be unstable (#13414).
- Improve operability by reworking what is logged to fc-qemu.log.


0.5 (2014-11-21)
----------------

- Root filesystem shrink during VM start (#13414).
- Add 'force-unlock' action to break stale locks (e.g., after a VM host went
  down).


0.4.3 (2014-11-13)
------------------

- Read Qemu config file template from `/etc/qemu/qemu.vm.cfg.in`.
- Fix tests and documentation.


0.4.2 (2014-11-12)
------------------

- Rate limit entropy transfer from host to guest (#13751).
- Add 'restart' command to simplify VM restarts.


0.4.1 (2014-09-24)
------------------

- Do not require the PID to match the machine name for determining
  online status. This caused issues for VMs with names longer than 11
  characters: http://status.flyingcircus.io/incidents/3j8wsrszlx2w


0.4 (2014-09-16)
----------------

- Allow selecting the specific command line to call for creating a VM

----------------

- Refactor and rename to 'fc.qemu'.
  Integrate most functionality that was previously placed in our
  init scripts and localconfig (fc.agent) utilities.
