0.4.2 (unreleased)
==================

- Nothing changed yet.


0.4.1 (2014-09-24)
==================

- Do not require the PID to match the machine name for determining
  online status. This caused issues for VMs with names longer than 11
  characters: http://status.flyingcircus.io/incidents/3j8wsrszlx2w


0.4 (2014-09-16)
================

- Allow selecting the specific command line to call for creating a VM
  using a config file + formatting syntax.

- Add test coverage to show that we gracefully recover from crashed VMs
  upon a subsequent 'ensure'.

0.3 (2014-09-13)
================

- Refactor and rename to 'fc.qemu'.
  Integrate most functionality that was previously placed in our
  init scripts and localconfig (fc.agent) utilities.

- Add a lot of test coverage.


0.2.6 (2014-08-21)
==================

- Fix incoming VM detection for an already locked _and_ started VM.


0.2.5 (2014-08-20)
==================

* Implement a safety-belt to prohibit migrating VMs that have not
  yet been started with the supported /run/kvm.*.cfg.in format.
