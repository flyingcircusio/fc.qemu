Release notes
=============

1.4.0 (2023-10-12)
------------------

- Introduce RBD-based locking for maintenances to ensure only a single
  KVM host can perform a maintenance at a time. (PL-131618)

- Stabilize the live migration test that was flaky depending on host
  performance. (PL-131812)

1.3.1 (2023-02-03)
------------------

- fix regression in guestagent Qemu.write_file, causing the
  mark-qemu-binary-generation calls to fail

- improve guestagent test coverage and mocking

1.3.0 (2023-01-17)
------------------

- porting to python3
- Ceph Nautilus compatibility

1.2.0 (2022-12-02)
------------------

- Adapt tests to Ceph Luminous


1.1.5 (2021-04-09)
------------------

- Fix AMD/Intel compatibility matrix for CPU bug flags
  (ssbd vs amd-ssbd et. al.) to avoid crashes in startup and live migration
  due to compatibility issues.

- Add newer AMD Epyc models.

- Prepare directory integration for Python 2/3 and Gentoo/NixOS compatibility.


1.1.4 (2020-11-06)
------------------

- Keep some of the unthawing improvements (timing, restructuring, ...) but do
  not use the alt-sysrq-j combination as too many guest kernels are actually
  allergic to this and need a reboot after this.

- Add support for AMD CPU models and simplify (and speed up) model
  detection. #3-126540

1.1.3 (2020-04-30)
------------------

- Improve unthawing reliability. Use the monitor to send alt-sysrq-j
  (global thaw) and only try the agent up to 3 times. Using a better hammer
  is more likely to succeed than using the same hammer over and over ...
  Helps in fixing #124656.


1.1.2 (2020-04-10)
------------------

- Improve performance of `report-supported-cpu-models` by explicitly stopping
  the test VM and avoiding the 2s timeouts to detect whether its running.


1.1.1 (2019-09-02)
------------------

- `report-supported-cpu-models` was leaking VMs if the host supported the model.


1.1 (2019-08-30)
----------------

- Add capabilities to discover, report and select CPU models supported
  by the hosts and requested by guests. #114627

- Move base support from Qemu 2.7 to Qemu 4.1

- Various test fixture improvements for test performance and stability.

- Add global 'shutdown-all' command to improve KVM host shutdown timing.



1.0.8 (2019-08-30)
------------------

- Brownbag release was intended to be 1.1.


1.0.7 (2019-03-27)
------------------

- Suppress error warnings when processing consul snapshot requests
  for foreign VMs.

1.0.6 (2019-03-26)
------------------

- Explicitly fail when trying to take a snapshot of a VM that isn't
  running locally. Also improve the snapshot output. (#108360)


1.0.5 (2019-02-14)
------------------

- Fix process matching we introduced in 1.0.4 to also cover long
  VM names. The proc.name() field under Linux only holds 16 bytes
  and we definitely have VM names that are much longer ...


1.0.4 (2019-02-05)
------------------

- Do not - I repeat - do not kill processes, based on the PID file, if the
  process name does not match the expected VM process naming pattern.

  This only manifested under a number of circumstances:

  * a Ceph bug was leaving deleted VMs unable to delete their locks
  * deleted VMs were sometimes considered stale
  * the targetted PID was suddenly different VM because we recycled
    PIDs much faster than expected (about every hour)


1.0.3 (2019-01-30)
------------------

- Add custom daemonization wrapper for Qemu to capture stdout/stdin/exit code (reliably).

- Add helper to support migrations on Ceph Hammer w/ broken lock IDs.

- Fix minor bug when showing status and Consul is inconsistent.


1.0.2 (2019-01-08)
------------------

- Fix an edge condition: VMs that are still shutting down and then asked to
  migrate may leave the inmigrate job hanging until it times out. We already
  have opportunistic handling of config changes and this is now one of them
  thus triggering a regular start of affected VMs much quicker.

- Opportunistically try to re-acquire lost locks. This is needed to avoid an invalid
  "inconsistent" decision and allows us to repair broken locks due to a
  Ceph bug. This will still cause visible failures if the lock can't
  be properly re-acquired.

- Clean up expectations around in-migrations and how to discover whether it
  makes sense to wait for an incoming migration. Use consul _and_ Ceph lock
  information and concentrate that decision in a single place.


1.0.1 (2018-06-04)
------------------

- Bugfix: having a staging config but no active config
  caused the agent to globally file and thus blocked creating new VMs.


1.0 (2018-05-23)
----------------

- Remove deprecated config file locking mechanism.

- Remove (synchronous and superfluous) memory compaction during VM startup to
  avoid unexpected delays that caused timeouts and delays VM startup
  unnecessarily.

- Improve the configuration file update process.

  This adds a staging area so that consul updates become faster and handling
  change events now has become asynchronous. Also, pay attention to the consul
  ModifyIndex here to avoid lost updates and use that for actual triggers.
  Includes a "settling" mechanism so that runs of `ensure` that see changes will
  look for further changes while holding the lock. This means that for every
  VM on a KVM host only one agent process will be running even if a flurry
  of updates is coming in.

- Introduce a host-specific migration lock: we want VMs to run as fast as
  possible and not overload the host. Having a single migration run at one point
  in time means there's a single TCP stream that will compete with different
  other steams that run on the same network (Ceph client in our case). Also,
  competing streams caused some streams to establish a slow speed that wouldn't
  increase after being the only one remaining.

  Further optimizations here include that hosts will retry quickly to get those
  locks and keep pushing migrations forward.

- Improve timeout handling for migrations.

  With the new asynchronous agent we now wait for a long time to discover our
  peer and have fixed missing timeout resets whenever our peer contacted us.
  (This was an issue with the now removed memory compaction that took longer
  than the timeout and would cause 'sudden death' on migrations.)

- Make the guest agent part of the 'ensure' method a bit more robust against
  missing guest agents.

- Improve cleanup of incoming migration services in consul. We did tend to
  leave old ones around. We will now try connecting to most recent
  services first, then try older ones and eliminate those that we can't talk
  to in the process. This may leave some around for a while but the tendency
  should be that they will get cleaned up at some point.


0.9.8 (2018-01-30)
------------------

- Restore bare except.


0.9.7 (2018-01-30)
------------------

- When several vm-inmigrate services are found, select the one with the highest
  'ModifyIndex' value.


0.9.6 (2018-01-30)
------------------

- Fix issue with using the `ls` and `check` commands. They do not perform
  regular locking as they do not use any of the critical resources and should
  not block nor be blocked by ongoing operations.

  Nevertheless, the cleanup code for managing Qemu QMP monitor connections
  accidentally triggered creating a superfluous session upon cleanup and
  that caused spurious blocks.


0.9.5 (2018-01-25)
------------------

- Relax version requirements for consulate (#27695).


0.9.4 (2017-12-19)
------------------

- Introduce a Nagios/Sensu compatible "check" command that performs a
  couple of checks. At the moment this verifies whether RAM allocations
  are met, both on a VM level (not exceeding guest memory + 2 times the
  expected overhead) and a host level (not exceeding guest memory +
  total overhead + 10%). This command may be expanded upon in the
  future to introduce more checks.

- Allow selecting the "disk cache mode" of Qemu so we can start disabling
  the writeback cache that keeps using way too much memory. #28840

- Extend the memory limiting feature to also verify whether the host
  actually has sufficient memory (in addition to sufficient bookable memory)
  and also include expected overhead in addition to the guest memory.

- Fix the fc-qemu global lock to use a dedicated lock file instead of
  (once again) using a file that might be moved around unexpectedly.


0.9.3 (2017-12-11)
------------------

- Disable watchdog: for newly started VMs, remove the device completely.
  For existing VMs (and future) disable the restart action. This fixes
  spontaneous reboots if VMs are under memory and IO pressure and fail to
  inform the watchdog appropriately. In general, it appears that the situations
  in which a watchdog will be helpful are very limited and the misbehaviour
  has become too much of a burden.


0.9.2 (2017-09-18)
------------------

- Fix guest agent timeout handling so that snapshots get an actual 120s
  timeout to allow VMs to properly flush their IO.


0.9.1 (2017-09-01)
------------------

- Remediate brownbag release: default config options were not properly included
  in release.


0.9 (2017-09-01)
----------------

- [feature] Allow managing host memory with a "maximum total" of memory that
  can be configured on VMs (-m switch). This is not based on actual RAM usage or availability but planned and configured values of currently running VMs!

  If a VM shall be inmigrated or started and the host would go beyond the
  'vm-max-total-memory' setting with that VM then the action will fail.

- [locking] Fix locking by moving to a separate lockfile and ensuring that
  reentrant use of locks is handled correctly. Also, provide upgrade scenario
  by additionally using the existing lock files.

- [locking] Ensure we rewrite the config file only when locked to reduce
  attack surface of the old mechanism while still upgrading.

- [logging] Improve logging with more specific debug output.

- [logging] Log the specific commandline that each Qemu process is started
  with to aid debugging.

- [logging] Switch logging from UTC to local server time. This has proven much
  more confusing as our other on-disk logs are in server time.

- [logging] Do not crash on broken logging (i.e. disk full or STDIO missing)
  to avoid accidentally crashing a VM just because the controlling script runs into issues.

- [logging] Add VM name prefixes also for stack dumps and tracebacks.

- [consul] Ensure that consul event handling doesn't fail the process when
  a thread fails. (Might be snake oil but doesn't hurt.)

- [consul] Reduce consul event handling pool from 10 to 3 to reduce strain on
  multiple parallel migrations.

- [ceph] Properly close RBD volume references to avoid librbd crash.

- [ceph] Ensure we don't open unnecessary duplicate RBD image handles.

- [qemu] Increase Qemu QMP timeout to 5 minutes to tolerate latency during
  migration cleanup as the QMP handler runs in the main thread and could be
  blocked for a long period.

- [migration] Improve outgoing migrations connecting to the incoming server:
  simplify code and reduce unnecessary waiting periods. Better error output.

- [migration] Improve live migration: skip compression, enable unlimited
  bandwidth, and use ephemeral ports to avoid running into TCP timing issues when retrying live migrations quickly.

- [config] Clean up default-option handling for some config options: we used
  two different styles of defaults. They have been unified into a single
  "default.conf" that gets loaded first.


0.8.11 (2017-05-29)
-------------------

- Add thousands separator in logging to live migration log to allow easier
  optical inspection.

- Improve fsfreeze timeout handling: this can take quite a while and if we
  are too eager then we end up quickly in unstable states.

- Improve error and debug logging.

- Improve resilience of continuing locally after a failed migration.


0.8.10 (2017-04-12)
-------------------

- Improve logging: include PID of the running process to help detect and
  understand potential conflicts in parallel runs.

- Try harder to catch errors and retry correctly when resetting communication
  with an agent.

- Add another layer to protect the guest agent by acquiring an exclusive lock
  on the guest agent socket file.

- Keep trying to ensure a VM is unfrozen during regular `ensure` calls.


0.8.9 (2017-04-07)
------------------

- Improve guest agent communication. The guest agent may be in an
  inconsistent state that causes it to hang. We've seen this happening
  where we froze machines and then have the agent be inconsistent.

  This now properly resets the agent connection upon a sync by sending
  the recommend "wrong" UTF-8 byte that guarantees to interrupt the
  guest agent's JSON parser.

- Improve logging output when destroying a VM because of an inconsistent
  state. (#25158)


0.8.8 (2016-11-18)
------------------

- Bugfix: migrations that ran into a timeout because the remote side
  did not respond accidentally unlocked and cleaned up without shutting
  the VM down properly. This resulted in multiple instances of a single VM.

0.8.7 (2016-11-11)
------------------

- Don't change anything if a VM is marked online but no KVM host is assigned
  (#23965).
- Refactor Agent.ensure() for improved reliability and readability.
- Decline to create a consistent snapshot if a VM is offline.
- Speed up tests a bit.
- Don't spawn unqualified partprobe invocations in parallel.
- Make debug level logging a bit less verbose.


0.8.6 (2016-11-04)
------------------

- Break inconsistent Ceph locks if the host holding an old lock is sure that a
  VM is not running anymore (#23695).
- Migration compatibility between Qemu 2.5 and 2.7 (#23695).
- Always clean up unused resources like Consul service registrations and run
  files.
- Improve error reporting and logging.


0.8.5 (2016-10-31)
------------------

- Fixed a major bug with event processing: the consul event processor was
  using the multiprocessing.pool API incorrectly. This wasn't caught by the
  tests and resulted in silent "no ops" of all event processing mechanisms.


0.8.4 (2016-10-31)
------------------

- Waiting for Qemu to shutdown gracefully was not expecting a socket error,
  which caused restarts to fail (cleanly). #24434

- Limit the number of parallel processed consul events to avoid
  overloading the host. Can be configured in the fc-qemu config file through::

    [consul]
    event-threads = <INT>

  The default is 10 threads.

- Lower the overhead of processing a consul config change event: do not
  activate Ceph and Qemu connections and do not perform scrubbing (ensure)
  when the config hasn't changed. Ceph and Qemu connections aren't needed in
  that case and scrubbing is expected to be performed in a separate task from
  a scheduler, not from an event handler that is supposed to only respond to
  changes.

- Provide a default for the binary-generation counter to allow smooth
  upgrades from previous versions.


0.8.3 (2016-10-23)
------------------

- Lower the guest agent timeout to help the tests complete faster and also
  stay responsive if the guest shouldn't have an agent available either
  yet, or currently, or generally.

- Provide a Qemu config template variable that will determine the most current
  Qemu machine type, given a prefix to filter for.

- Provide a "binary generation counter" that is a) injected a boot
  (to /tmp/fc-data/qemu-binary-generation-booted) and b) updated during every
  "ensure" command (to /run/qemu-binary-generation-current). The guest should
  use a difference between those files to schedule a cold reboot (i.e. a
  shutdown) to restart with a fresh Qemu binary.


0.8.2 (2016-09-20)
------------------

- Switch from using multiprocessing to threaded management of multiple consul
  VM event handlers to reduce Python startup overhead when processing many VMs
  in a single location. Also remove the sleep time.

- Fix log error in consul snapshot event handling. Improve the test coverage
  for consul event handling.

- Remove superfluous VM name handling where a VM config file could be
  specified instead of a VM name. This was causing obfuscation in the code
  and was barely used anyway.

- Allow using the telnet command even when fc.qemu _thinks_ that the VM
  is not running. This command is helpful for debugging and blocking it
  is a useless seatbelt.

- Do not log QMP connection errors as the are extremely common and expected.


0.8.1 (2016-09-11)
------------------

- Explicitly add logging to /var/log/fc-qemu.log. Do not filter
  log output there: we always want all the information we can get.

0.8 (2016-09-08)
----------------

- Introduce `fc-qemu telnet` command: a shortcut to connect to the human
  monitor port without having to look up the port from a config manually.

- Switch the monitor automation from using the telnet port to using the QMP
  socket. This should be a _lot_ more reliable. This also fixes a previous
  race condition where a migration status check may intermittently fail and
  then break a migration unnecessarily.

- Update vagrant environment to check against Qemu 2.6.

- Revamp output formatting to use Hynek's great structlog library.

- Limit a few more commands to specific VM states: stop only when running.

- Implement IOPS limiting either based on VM-specific ENC data,
  a Ceph pool default, or a global default. This limits IOPS for all disks
  (individually, no groups, yet) in a VM and maintains this over time.

- Rework Ceph volume unlocking: if a client owns a lock then breaking it
  will cause an immediate disconnect of the rbd/rados connection to avoid
  it sending further data updates. This can happen to us if we're setting
  up the locks on an inmigration and then have to give them up again if the
  migration fails.

0.7.22 (2016-07-21)
-------------------

- Fix bug in `fc-qemu restart` which causes mkfs.xfs for tmp to fail.


0.7.21 (2016-06-20)
-------------------

- Moderate swap and tmp volume sizes so that they do not scale linearly for very
  large VMs. #21961


0.7.20 (2016-05-03)
-------------------

- More logging output to help diagnosing a rare lock recovery failure
  (#21345).
- Remove shrink-vm. R.I.P. (#14222).


0.7.19 (2016-04-08)
-------------------

- Fix a race condition: when continuously polling monitor status to determine
  whether a VM is running, also consider the option that the VM was about
  to shutdown and the monitor has gone away.


0.7.18 (2016-04-04)
-------------------

- Another brownbag release: the snapshot refactoring wasn't tested properly
  if snapshots actually existed.


0.7.17 (2016-04-04)
-------------------

- Fix unicode/str issue: consul json decoded into unicode but librbd requires
  a plain string.

0.7.16 (2016-03-31)
-------------------

- Fix regression in snapshot taking.


0.7.15 (2016-03-20)
-------------------

- Account for different mkfs options for XFS and mkfs.ext4 (#19079).
- Improved Vagrant VM bootstrapping.
- Refactor classes in hazmat/{ceph.py,volume.py} (#19079).
- Use the "rbd_pool" ENC option to allow VM-specific selection of the RBD pool
  instead of deriving it from the resource group name.
- Improve success rate of recovering from failed migrations properly: certain
  conditions would result in only partially released locks from the target
  leading to inconsistent states.

0.7.14 (2016-01-21)
-------------------

- Use XFS for tmp partitions (#17873).
- Drop super-floppy setup von vdc and use a proper partition table instead
  (#17873).
- Fix file permissions for ENC seed JSON file.


0.7.13 (2015-12-10)
-------------------

- Ignore consul requests for VMs with missing configuration (#18841).
- Speed up initial NTP sync in Vagrant to avoid failing Ceph tests due to
  unsynced MONs.
- Refine Ceph.unlock() to remove own locks in a best-effort manner. This is
  needed to recover from incomplete migrations (#18771).
- Improve error handling with failed monitor connections.


0.7.12 (2015-11-11)
-------------------

- Improve error handling during migration.
- Fix timeout during fsfreeze that leads to locked up VMs (#18917).


0.7.11 (2015-11-04)
-------------------

- Switch `aio` setting in default qemu.vm.cfg to "threads". This will keep
  fc-qemu compatible with future Qemu versions (#18743).
- Improve logging.
- Place initial copy of ENC data in `/tmp/fc-data/enc.json`.


0.7.10 (2015-08-12)
-------------------

- Refactor system-wide configuration code.
- Create swap and tmp partition with proper filesystem labels (#16783).
- Fix rare race condition during tmp volume creation.
- Set filesystem labels for swap and tmp volumes (#17078).


0.7.9 (2015-08-03)
------------------

- Add "snapshot" command. Can be triggered from command line and
  via consul.


0.7.8 (2015-07-27)
------------------

- Improve detection of running instances.

- Broaden check for monitor connection to handle dual stack
  environments.


0.7.7 (2015-07-14)
------------------

- Fix migration issue: we ended up de-registering at the wrong time.


0.7.6 (2015-07-01)
------------------

- Quickfix: newer mkfs.ext4 versions need a '-F' flag to overwrite
  filesystems (#14920).


0.7.5 (2015-07-01)
------------------

- Spawn individual VM actions usings multiprocessing. Wait until all migrations
  are done (#14920).
- Increase allowed migration downtime to keep migration time for busy VMs in
  bounds (#14920).
- Fix exception handling errors during Consul event processing (#14920).
- Give udev mapping a bit to settle.
- Improve log readability.


0.7.4 (2015-06-02)
------------------

- Rectify brown-bag release.
- Fix some unnoticed, arbitrary test failures.


0.7.3 (2015-06-02)
------------------

- Make event processing from consul fork for each VM and return the
  master process early to avoid blocking the consul agent.

- More logging related to migrations.


0.7.2 (2015-05-26)
------------------

- Adapt to QEMU 2.2.1: uses now stdvga by default (#15748).


0.7.1 (2015-05-20)
------------------

- Fix bug with inmigration Consul service registration (#15313).
- Change KV name name space for nodes from "vm/" to "node/" (#14920).


0.7 (2015-05-18)
----------------

- Consul service registration (#15313).
- Coordinate migration via Consul (#15313).


0.6.4 (2015-02-27)
------------------

- Tolerate "setup" as an intermediate migration status as encountered in the
  wild.


0.6.3 (2015-02-19)
------------------

- Improve pid file parser to deal correctly with trailing lines and empty pid
  files.
- Ensure that exceptions are properly logged if they occur directly after
  daemonizing (e.g., in Agent.__init__()) (#13867).


0.6.2 (2015-01-22)
------------------

- Relax PyYaml and psutil version requirements to accommodate to the Flying
  Circus managed platform.


0.6.1 (2015-01-22)
------------------

- Improve logging and error messages (#13867).
- Fix unwanted behaviour during error conditions (#13867).


0.6 (2015-01-15)
----------------

- Implement live migration. Use "inmigrate" and "outmigrate" commands
  to coordinate the process (#13229).
- Note that the qemu.cfg.in template has changed!
- Improve test coverage.


0.5.1 (2014-11-22)
------------------

- Bugfix: remove Ceph discard call since it seems to be unstable (#13414).
- Improve operability by reworking what is logged to fc-qemu.log.


0.5 (2014-11-21)
----------------

- Root filesystem shrink during VM start (#13414).
- Add 'force-unlock' action to break stale locks (e.g., after a VM host went
  down).


0.4.3 (2014-11-13)
------------------

- Read Qemu config file template from `/etc/qemu/qemu.vm.cfg.in`.
- Fix tests and documentation.


0.4.2 (2014-11-12)
------------------

- Rate limit entropy transfer from host to guest (#13751).
- Add 'restart' command to simplify VM restarts.


0.4.1 (2014-09-24)
------------------

- Do not require the PID to match the machine name for determining
  online status. This caused issues for VMs with names longer than 11
  characters: http://status.flyingcircus.io/incidents/3j8wsrszlx2w


0.4 (2014-09-16)
----------------

- Allow selecting the specific command line to call for creating a VM
  using a config file + formatting syntax.

- Add test coverage to show that we gracefully recover from crashed VMs
  upon a subsequent 'ensure'.

0.3 (2014-09-13)
----------------

- Refactor and rename to 'fc.qemu'.
  Integrate most functionality that was previously placed in our
  init scripts and localconfig (fc.agent) utilities.

- Add a lot of test coverage.


0.2.6 (2014-08-21)
------------------

- Fix incoming VM detection for an already locked _and_ started VM.


0.2.5 (2014-08-20)
------------------

* Implement a safety-belt to prohibit migrating VMs that have not
  yet been started with the supported /run/kvm.*.cfg.in format.
