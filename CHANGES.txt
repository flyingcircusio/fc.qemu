- Relax PyYaml and psutil version requirements to accommodate to the Flying
  Circus managed platform.

------------------

- Improve logging and error messages (#13867).

0.6 (2015-01-15)
----------------

- Implement live migration. Use "inmigrate" and "outmigrate" commands
  to coordinate the process (#13229).

0.5.1 (2014-11-22)
------------------

- Bugfix: remove Ceph discard call since it seems to be unstable (#13414).

0.5 (2014-11-21)
----------------

- Root filesystem shrink during VM start (#13414).
- Add 'force-unlock' action to break stale locks (e.g., after a VM host went
  down).


0.4.3 (2014-11-13)
------------------

- Read Qemu config file template from `/etc/qemu/qemu.vm.cfg.in`.

0.4 (2014-09-16)
----------------

- Allow selecting the specific command line to call for creating a VM

  Integrate most functionality that was previously placed in our
  init scripts and localconfig (fc.agent) utilities.

* Implement a safety-belt to prohibit migrating VMs that have not
  yet been started with the supported /run/kvm.*.cfg.in format.
